# **Study Overview**  

In this homework assignment, we will analyze genotyping data from 9 dog breeds.  

Read the paper *"The Shepherds’ Tale: A Genome-Wide Study across 9 Dog Breeds Implicates Two Loci in the Regulation of Fructosamine Serum Concentration in Belgian Shepherds"* by Forsberg et al.  
Link: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0123173

Carefully review the **abstract**, **introduction**, **discussion**, and **GWAS results** sections, then answer the following questions:  

# **Questions**  

**1. Biological Context:**  
- What is **fructosamine**, and why is it used as a biomarker in clinical studies? (Limit: 30 words)  
- Which disease is associated with abnormal fructosamine levels?  

```{}
- Fructosamine reflects average blood glucose levels over 2–3 weeks, providing a short-term measure of glycemic control in clinical studies.
- Diabetes mellitus is associated with abnormal fructosamine levels.
```

**2. Breed-Specific Risk:**  
- Based on the paper, which dog breeds are at **low risk** and which are at **high risk** of developing this disease?  

```{}
- Low Risk: Boxers and the shepherd breeds are identified as being at low risk of developing diabetes mellitus.

- High Risk: The remaining breeds are reported to have a high risk of developing diabetes mellitus.
```

**3. Study Objective and Hypothesis:**  
- What is the primary objective of this study?  
- Summarize the authors' main hypothesis (Limit: 100 words)  

```{}
- The primary objective of this study is to identify genetic factors influencing variation in serum fructosamine concentrations in dogs, with a focus on breed-specific differences, particularly in Belgian Shepherds, to understand potential protective mechanisms against diabetes mellitus.

- The authors hypothesize that genetics play a big role in controlling fructosamine levels in dogs, and that this varies by breed. They believe that Belgian Shepherds might have developed genetic traits that help protect them from diabetes.
```

**4. Dogs as Models for Diseases:**  
- Why are domestic dogs considered valuable models for studying the genetics of **complex diseases**?  
- What specific characteristics of domestic dogs make them particularly suitable for genetic studies, especially for **GWAS**?  

```{}
- Domestic dogs share many complex diseases with humans, including diabetes mellitus, and have coexisted in similar environments, making them a good choice for studying shared genetic and environmental influences on disease.

- Dogs have high genetic diversity between breeds but reduced variation within breeds due to selective breeding. This creates long haplotypes and clear genetic patterns, which simplify the identification of disease-associated loci in GWAS.

# **Part 1: Bobby and Population Genetics**

Last month, you adopted a 2.5-year-old mixed-breed dog named Bobby.  
He is very cute, friendly, and quite heavy (weighs 30kg).  
Therefore, you are pretty confident he is a mix of big dog breeds.

To solve the mystery of Bobby’s ancestry, you did what any reasonable person would do - asked your friend from the faculty of biology to genotype a sample of Bobby.

For this part, we’re focusing *only* on "big dogs" (over 20kg) as candidates for Bobby’s relatives.  

(1) Generate a boxplot to visualize body weight by breed
  - Color and order the plot.  
  - Label axes and remove NAs (pretty graphs = extra points!).  
  - Need inspiration? Check out this site: https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/
(2) Based on the boxplot, create a variable called `candidate_breeds` that stores the dog breeds weighing 20kg or more

```{r}
# Filter out "big dogs" (over 20kg) and remove NAs
big_dogs <- pheno[pheno$Body_weight > 20 & !is.na(pheno$Body_weight) & !is.na(pheno$Breed), ]

# Create a pastel rainbow palette
pastel_rainbow <- scales::alpha(rainbow(7), 0.6) # 0.6 adjusts the transparency for a pastel look

# Generate the boxplot with pastel rainbow colors
ggplot(big_dogs, aes(x = Breed, y = Body_weight, fill = Breed)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = 21, outlier.size = 2, outlier.color = "black") + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = pastel_rainbow) +  # Use the pastel rainbow palette
  labs(
    title = "Body Weight by Breed (Big Dogs Only)",
    x = "Breed",
    y = "Body Weight (kg)"
  ) +
  theme_light() + 
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, family = "roboto"), 
    axis.text.y = element_text(family = "roboto"),                        
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, family = "lobster", size = 16), 
    axis.title.x = element_text(family = "lobster"),                      
    axis.title.y = element_text(family = "lobster")               
  )

# 2: S
candidate_breeds <- unique(big_dogs$Breed) # Get unique breed names from big_dogs
```

- Think of a computational method that we learned in class that will help you visualize and decide what dog breed Bobby is most likely related to.
(1) Use only data from `geno` that belongs to `candidate_breeds`
(2) Load Bobby's genotyping results file: `bobby.geno`
(3) Do not forget to plot (pretty graphs get extra points!)
TIP: use one of `factoextra` functions for the visualization and color the different dogs breeds

```{r warning=FALSE}


# Load Bobby's genotyping results
bobby_geno <- read.table("bobby.geno", header = TRUE, row.names = 1)
# align columns:
geno <- geno[, order(colnames(geno))]
bobby_geno <- bobby_geno[, order(colnames(bobby_geno))]
all.equal(colnames(geno), colnames(bobby_geno))

# Match IDs of candidate breeds in pheno
candidate_ids <- rownames(pheno[pheno$Breed %in% candidate_breeds, ])

# Subset geno for these IDs
geno_subset <- geno[rownames(geno) %in% candidate_ids, ]

#make sure still aligned
all(rownames(geno_subset) == candidate_ids) 


# Add Bobby's data to geno_subset
geno_combined <- rbind(geno_subset, bobby_geno)

# Remove constant/zero-variance columns
geno_clean <- geno_combined[, apply(geno_combined, 2, var) > 0]

# Scale the data
geno_matrix <- scale(geno_clean)
# Perform PCA
pca_results <- prcomp(geno_matrix, center = TRUE, scale. = TRUE)

library(factoextra)
# Add a column to indicate breeds, including Bobby
geno_labels <- c(pheno$Breed[rownames(pheno) %in% rownames(geno_subset)], "Bobby")

# Plot PCA
fviz_pca_ind(
  pca_results,
  label = "none",                  # Do not label individual points
  habillage = geno_labels,         # Color points by breed
  addEllipses = TRUE,              # Add ellipses for breed clusters
  ellipse.level = 0.95,            # 95% confidence level
  repel = TRUE                     # Avoid overlapping labels
) +
  labs(
    title = "PCA of Genetic Data: Bobby's Closest Breed",
    x = "Principal Component 1",
    y = "Principal Component 2"
  ) +
  theme_light() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, family = "lobster", size = 16),       
    axis.title.x = element_text(hjust = 0.5, family = "roboto"),   
    axis.title.y = element_text(hjust = 0.5, family = "roboto")    
  )


```


- Answer the following questions:
(1) Which dog breed is the most similar to Bobby?
(2) Look at the clusters of Labrador, Belgian and German Shepherd and imagine lines that connect the centroids of those cluster which results in an equilateral triangle. Is it true to say that the similarity between Belgian Shepherd to German Shepherd is equal to the similarity between Belgian Shepherd to Labrador? Explain.

```{}
(# Write yourt answers here:
(1) Bobby is most similar to the Labrador Retriever, as the PCA plot shows his position is closest to the Labrador Retriever cluster.

(2) It is not true to say that the similarity between Belgian Shepherd and German Shepherd is equal to the similarity between Belgian Shepherd and Labrador Retriever:
Belgian Shepherd is genetically more similar to German Shepherd than to Labrador Retriever, as shown by the shorter PCA distance between their clusters.

```


# **Part 2: GWAS Analysis**

- Make sure geno, map and pheno left unchanged.
```{r}
geno <- read.table("dogs.geno")
map <- read.table("dogs.map")
pheno <- read.table("dogs.pheno", header = T)
```

- Create a gData object and call it `gDataDogs`:
(1) Make sure that your data match the instructions in `?createGData()`
(2) Make a list called `dogsPhenoList` of different dog breeds out of `pheno` and use only the column `genotype` and `FRUCTO`
```{r}
colnames(map)[2:3] <- c("chr", "pos") # Rename Chromosome and Position columns
rownames(map) <- map[["V1"]] # Use genotypes as row name

map <- map[order(rownames(map)), ]
geno <- geno[, order(colnames(geno))]

all(rownames(map) == colnames(geno))

pheno$genotype <- rownames(pheno)
dogsPhenoList <- split(x = pheno[c("genotype", "FRUCTO")], 
                        f = pheno[["Breed"]])

gDataDogs <- createGData(geno = geno, map = map, pheno = dogsPhenoList)

```

- Run a GWAS analysis for Belgian Shepherd with fructosamine concentrations:
(1) Show the QQ- and Manhattan plots 
(2) Print significant SNP(s)
```{r}
# Load necessary libraries
library(statgenGWAS)

# Run GWAS for Belgian Shepherds on Fructosamine concentration
GWAS_BelgianShepherd <- runSingleTraitGwas(
  gData = gDataDogs,
  trials = "Belgian Shepherd",
  traits = "FRUCTO"
)

# QQ Plot: Assess potential population structure or true associations
plot(GWAS_BelgianShepherd, 
     plotType = "qq", 
     trait = "FRUCTO",
     title = "QQ Plot - Belgian Shepherd GWAS")

# Manhattan Plot: Identify genome-wide significant SNPs
plot(GWAS_BelgianShepherd, 
     plotType = "manhattan", 
     trait = "FRUCTO",
     title = "Manhattan Plot - Belgian Shepherd GWAS")

# Extract and display significant SNPs
significant_snps <- GWAS_BelgianShepherd$signSnp$"Belgian Shepherd"

# Print results
if (nrow(significant_snps) > 0) {
  # Use kable to display the table
  kable(significant_snps, row.names = FALSE, caption = "Significant SNPs") 
} else {
  # Print a friendly message
  cat("\nNo SNPs passed the genome-wide significance threshold.\n")
}
```

- Answer the following questions using the QQ- and Manhattan plot:
(1) While presenting your GWAS results in an international dog-lovers confrence, an elderly woman with a well-groomed Pekingese dog in her bag, challenge your interpretation from the QQ plot. She claims that the deviation observed in the QQ plot could be due to difference in the population structure rather than true genetic associations. Briefly describe how you would respond to her concerns given your QQ plot results.
(2) A curious breeder from the audience, intrigued by the implications, posed the another question: "Could you explain how the location of these significant SNP(s) on your plot help us understand genetic associations with the trait?"

```{}
1. In the observed QQ plot the x axis is the p-values under the null hypotesis and the y axis it the actual p values observed. In a proper GWAS we would expect most of the SNP to not have a significant effect and match the null hypotesis.
Having a dot on the line meaning the p value matches the null hypotesis therefore not significant.
The closer a dot to the upper right corner, the lower the p value of this SNP, therefore the higher the significance of it.
Population structure creates genetic differences between different groups in the population and they effect the distribution of SNPs.This causes p values to be lower than we would expect even for random SNPs, so the QQ Plot moves away from the blue line from the start.
Thus if we had deviation due to difference in the population structure we would likely see the whole SNP p values above the null hypotesis blue line for the whole plot.

2. In the observed Manhattan plots the x axis is the chromosom in which the SNP is located and the y axis is the level of statictical significance of the SNP. The observed threshold is the level at which a SNP is considered statistically significant. Black/gray dots are SNPs without significant association while red dots are SNPs that passed the threshold of statistical significance, which may indicate a gene relevant to the trait under study.
The plot shows highly significant SNP on Chromosome 3 (BICF2S2344808).


```


- Make a boxplot of Fructosamine concentrations for different alleles in Belgian and German Shepherds:
(1) Use only the genotypes of Labrador Retriever, Belgian and German Shepherd
(2) The X-axis should be the different alleles (0, 1, and 2) of the most significant SNP from the Belgian Shepherd GWAS results
(3) Remove rows with NAs in fructosamine concentrations

```{r}
# Define the most significant SNP from GWAS results
top_snp <- "BICF2S2344808"  # Replace with the actual significant SNP ID

# Filter phenotype data for selected breeds (Belgian, German Shepherds, and Labrador Retrievers)
selected_breeds <- c("Belgian Shepherd", "German Shepherd", "Labrador Retriever")
pheno_filtered <- subset(pheno, Breed %in% selected_breeds) %>% subset(!is.na(FRUCTO))
pheno_filtered$Allele <- geno[pheno_filtered$genotype,top_snp] 

# Define a pastel rainbow color palette for breeds
pastel_rainbow <- alpha(rainbow(length(selected_breeds)), 0.6) # Adjust transparency for pastel look

# Generate the boxplot
ggplot(pheno_filtered, aes(x = factor(Allele), y = FRUCTO, fill = Breed)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = 21, outlier.size = 2, outlier.color = "black") + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = pastel_rainbow) +  # Use the pastel rainbow palette
  labs(
    x = "SNP Allele (0, 1, 2)",
    y = "Fructosamine Concentration"
  ) +
  theme_light() + 
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(hjust = 1, family = "roboto"), 
    axis.text.y = element_text(family = "roboto"),                        
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, family = "lobster", size = 16), 
    axis.title.x = element_text(family = "lobster"),                      
    axis.title.y = element_text(family = "lobster")
  ) + ggtitle("Fructosamine Concentrations by SNP Allele\n(Belgian Shepherd, German Shepherds, Labradors)")


```

- Answer the following questions:
(1) Describe the results from the box-plot with respect the three allels (0, 1 and 2) and the three dog breeds.
(2) Name the most significant SNP, indicates the chromosome and positions.
```{}
1. In the boxplot, the x axis is different SNP alleles (0, 1, 2) in Belgian Shepherds, German Shepherds, and Labrador Retrievers and the y axis is the fructosamine concentration for each of the SNP alleles by breed.
Results by allels:
Allel 0: Highest median of fructosamine concentration observed in the Labrador breed while the variaty of fructosamine concentration is similar to Belgian and German Shepherd, although German's Shepherd median is slightly higher.
Allel 1: Highest median with a wide spread of fructosamine concentration observed in the Labrador breed, moderate fructosamine concentration for Belgian Shephard and very few data points for German Shephard.
Allel 2: More variation observed between Belgian Shepherds and Labradors compared to German Shepherds. Highest median for Belgian Shepherd and high levels for Labrador.

All together, Labrador Retrievers generally have higher fructosamine levels compared to Belgian and German Shepherds, SNP allele 2 is associated with the highest fructosamine levels, especially in Labrador Retrievers and Belgian Shepherds and German Shepherds tend to have lower fructosamine levels, especially with allele 0.

2. The most significant SNP is BICF2S2344808, located in chromosome 3, postion 65209415.

- Go to - "http://genome-euro.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway".
- Select "Dog" from the list of species in the left.
- Select dog assembly: "May 2005 (Broad/canFam2)".
- Select and use the chromosome and position of the SNP from the first question and click "GO".
- Click on the last layer in the genome browser (Simple Nucleotide Polymorphism - rs23514694)

* The first part of this video can be useful: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8U5NhHofPI0

(1) Write the nucleotides combinations of the three different alleles
```{}
The observed is C/T and the reference allele is C thus:
allel 0 is C/C
allel 1 is C/T
allel 2 is T/T
```

- Go back to the genome browser
- Zoom out (x100) three times - in the top right.
- Identify human proteins that are mapped using tBLAST to this dog genome region

(2) Choose 5 proteins and check if they are mentioned in the paper. If they are mentioned, explain how they are relevant to the trait.
```{}
5 human proteins that are mapped to the above dog genome region are:
1. CAPN5
2. FGFR3
3. GAPDH
4. MAEA
5. WHSC1

Out of them, FGFR3, GAPDH and WHSC1 appear in the study.

FGFR3:
Part of the cell growth, development, and metabolism. Its signal involved in insulin sensitivity and glucose regulation, potentially affecting fructosamine levels.

GAPDH:
It's an enzyme in glycolysis, the pathway that breaks down glucose for energy. This directly affects glucose metabolism, influencing blood sugar levels and fructosamine concentration.

WHSC1:
Part of chromatin structure regulation and affecting gene expression. Could impact glucose metabolism genes, indirectly influencing fructosamine levels.
```
